                          Legacy Garment Care is a family owned and operated business 
                          since 1992. Our company began by buying out the establishment 
                          where our founder worked. Through years of effort and 
                          dedication, we now have a number of retail locations 
                          in the metro area. We take great pride in our work and 
                          continue to make strides in providing high quality garment 
                          care to all of our clients. Our production plant consists 
                          of 10,000 square feet, where our staff has access to 
                          the most advanced equipment that results in a finish 
                          product that compares to none. Legacy is also conscious 
                          of the ecological changes in our environment. We make 
                          strides in using the most eco-friendly methods in the 
                          industry. <br />

                          and corporate accounts. At Legacy Garment Care, no account 
                          is too small or too large to handle. <br />
